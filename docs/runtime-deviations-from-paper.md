# Runtime Deviations from Paper Design

This file enumerates intentional deviations from `igloo-paper` design caused by protocol
or architectural constraints. Each entry cites the Paper source, the web-demo-v2 implementation,
and the validation assertion IDs that cover it.

## Deviations

### ECDH round-trip — responder side does not emit `CompletedOperation::Ecdh`

- **Paper / task source**: `fix-m1-ecdh-roundtrip-spec-real-dispatch` feature description
  (`features.json`) — "runtimeCompletions on page A contains an entry with type='ecdh' and the
  captured request_id; page B also observes an Ecdh completion correlated by the same request_id".
- **web-demo-v2 implementation**: `src/e2e/multi-device/ecdh-roundtrip.spec.ts`.
- **Protocol constraint**: Per `bifrost-rs/crates/bifrost-signer/src/lib.rs`,
  `CompletedOperation::Ecdh { request_id, shared_secret }` is only pushed by the **initiator**
  of an ECDH session (`initiate_ecdh` / its response-finalisation branch). The **responder**
  processes the `EcdhRequest`, creates its partial ECDH package via `ecdh_create_from_share`,
  and sends an `EcdhResponse` envelope back to the initiator — it does NOT itself finalize
  (`ecdh_finalize` only runs on the initiator once it has enough responses), does NOT cache
  the derived secret, and does NOT push an `Ecdh` completion. The protocol is intentionally
  asymmetric: only the initiator derives the shared secret on-chain.
- **What the spec asserts instead**: the initiator (page A) receives `CompletedOperation::Ecdh`
  with the captured `request_id` and a valid 32-byte `shared_secret_hex32`. The responder
  (page B) is validated by observing its `lifecycleEvents` drain at least one
  `InboundAccepted`-kind runtime event and its `runtimeStatus.peers[A].last_seen` advancing —
  both indirect proofs that B accepted and processed the inbound ECDH request. B never holds
  an `Ecdh` entry keyed by the request_id because the bifrost protocol does not produce one.
- **Assertion IDs covered**: VAL-OPS-009 (ECDH happy path surfaces a completion on the
  initiator). The task description's phrase "both pages" is reconciled here against the
  protocol — the responder's participation is an input to, not an output of,
  `CompletedOperation::Ecdh`.
